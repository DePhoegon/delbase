==================================================

Followup steps (after fences)
- triple check all the blocks
- Crafting recipes
== get JEI/NEI intergration if possible
- turn own dyes into 'small piles' (x8) to use on blocks in world
- use tags to do crafting reciepes  to allow use of normal dyes to turn 8 of a set into 8 of one color
- 'consider' custom machine to do colors [ not looking favorable]
- 'consider' custom machine to take apart armor/items to recover resources
- 'consider' nether touches.
- 'consider' obsidian for variants
- 'consider' item to take the color out of blocks
== 'consider' destroying block in exchange for some color/blocks
== 'consider' blocks that would be useful with this.
== 'consider' swapping out blocks for another for colors (ideas like full logs/wood blocks)
